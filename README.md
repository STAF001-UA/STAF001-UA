- Strong Through Art Foundation (STAF), is a foundation that helps children hurt by war. We care about people and want to stop the pain of children who suffer most from war.

- In the face of difficulties, the Strong Through Art Foundation (STAF) stands as a humanitarian foundation with a dual purpose: to provide relief to young souls caught in the crossfire of armed conflict and to foster cultural
- connections through the world of art. Our foundation operates with the understanding that children are the innocent victims of war, facing physical, mental and emotional trauma that no child should have to endure.

- We have a strong conviction in the transformative power of art to bring healing, inspiration, and positive change. Governed by a comprehensive Code of Conduct and ethical principles, our endeavors are grounded in compassion,
- integrity, and a profound dedication to improving the world for each child impacted by the devastations of war.

- Our commitment transcends geographical boundaries, reaching out to children in war zones, refugee camps, and those trapped in the grip of conflict. STAF works in collaboration with local foundations and specialized organizations,
- directing resources to the areas where they are most essential. Through these endeavors, our goal is to support projects that reconstruct shattered lives, reinstate a sense of normalcy, and offer a beacon of hope in the darkest of times.

- As you delve into the initiatives and projects of our foundation, and discover the vibrant community of artists and art enthusiasts rallying behind our cause, we extend an invitation for you to embark on this journey of compassion and
- transformation with us. Together, we have the power to create a lasting impact on the lives of these resilient children, showcasing that even in the face of adversity, the forces of art and humanity ultimately triumph.
